# What's this
Welcome to my sad neovim configuration! Make yourself at home and take what you want from this repo. 

NOTE: I made this configuration based on kickstart.nvim. If you want to start writing your own config, I highly recommend for you to check them out!

# ...Why?
Well, that's pretty easy question! 

My goals here are: 
- besting my abilities: I want to deepen my knowledge abt (neo)vim, so I can not only became better (neo)vim user, but also better coder; That also means...
- minimalism: I will only add these plugins that I can't live without (i.e. telescope, treesitter etc. etc.) and aren't already natively in nvim,
- trying to better understand my workflow and how I can improve it. 

# Installation
First of all, remember to back up your previous config.
```shell
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}
```

You can also backup those files, but I personally never do that.
```shell
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
```

After you're done with backuping you can just paste that in your shell
```shell
git clone https://github.com/holykremowka2137/init.lua.git ~/.config/nvim
```

And you're done! Good job.
